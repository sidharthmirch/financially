# Financially
A budget and expense management application.

The app will allow users to:
- Create budgets
- Record expenses
- Visualize spending

As someone who is bad at budgeting and an impulse buyer, I believe that I am the target audience for the application. Being able to visualize my spending by category and setting budgets for each week/month would allow me to feel more in control of my finances and be more aware of the impact each purchase makes. I hope.

**USER STORIES**
- As a user, I want to be able to create a budget
- As a user, I want to be able to add a transaction (deposit/withdrawal) to my transaction list
