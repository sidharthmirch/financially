# Financially
A budget and expense management application.

The app will allow users to:
- Create budgets
- Record expenses
- Visualize spending

As someone who is bad at budgeting and an impulse buyer, I believe that I am the target audience for the application. Being able to visualize my spending by category and setting budgets for each week/month would allow me to feel more in control of my finances and be more aware of the impact each purchase makes. I hope.

**USER STORIES**
- As a user, I want to be able to create a budget
- As a user, I want to be able to add a transaction (deposit/withdrawal) to my transaction list
- As a user, I want to be able to see how much of my budget remains
- As a user, I want to be able to see how much money I have
- As a user, when I select the quit option, I want to be reminded to save the data from my current session to file and have the option to do so or not
- As a user, when the application starts, I want to be given the option to load my account from file


# Instructions for Grader

- You can generate the first required action related to adding Xs to a Y by navigating to the Transactions and selecting either "Record Deposit" or "Record Withdrawal". After you enter the size of your Transaction, select "OK" and then you should be able to see your new Transaction (X) has been added to our list of transactions (Y).
- You can generate the second required action related to adding Xs to a Y by selecting a display option from the dropdown box found in the Transactions menu. You can choose to display all transactions that are either Deposits, Withdrawals, or both.
- You can locate my visual component by loading the application. My visual component was my splashscreen.
- You can save the state of my application by hovering over the "Options" menu item, and then selecting "Save". 
- You can reload the state of my application by hovering over the "Options" menu item, and then selecting "Load".
